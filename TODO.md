# TODO

Notes on bugs, features, and updates. 

---

### Bugs

- When the heatmap window changes, the color scale is re-scaled accordingly. It should be globally determined. 


### Feature 

- It would be nice to auto-scale the scatter plots to an x- and y-axis set by the minimum and maximum binding measurement of the whole library. 

### Update

- I need to cache some of these plots to speed up the analysis.
